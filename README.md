# tic-tac-toe-refactor

##What is this?
Refactoring my work on tic-tac-toe.  Why?

###1.  
I kept going back and forth in my head on whether or not I should use a 2D map or a simple list for the board. 2D map is getting messy.  Let's try a list and see how far we get.

###2. 
Apparently my formatting is all wrong.  I think it's neater to space the millions of parentheses a certain way (sooooo many parantheses) but Lisp standards disagree.

###3.
I need to modularize my functions better so that I can actually test them.  Testing got really weird when I had functions who were responsible for manipulating data and displaying data.  Keep them separate!

###4.
I designed the last one way to OOPy and it's been a pain to fix.  I'm going to try to be more functional from the start.

##Clojure
A crazy funtional programming language with immutable data-structures.  Soooo immutable.  Second stab.  Here we go!
